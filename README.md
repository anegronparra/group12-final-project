GoatBucks Clicker.
A game based on “Cookie Clicker”, but geared towards WPI students. The goal of the game is to make GoatBucks by clicking the GoatButton in the middle. You can use your GoatBucks to invest in WPI restaurants to generate more passive GoatBucks. Get as much as you can!
While typically these games are endless, your time at school isn’t, so once you get the max upgrades before you reach the end of “senior year”, then you graduate on time and you win! If not then you’re going to have to repeat all your years (years are based on a timer).

We will be using Node.js, Javascript, React, Glitch.
